 ideology_break_1_2_event.1.d: "In recent weeks, a prominent and influential officer within our esteemed army has boldly voiced his opposition to establishing diplomatic ties with those he deems as enemies of the state. His impassioned words have quickly ignited a fervor within the armed forces, with echoes now resounding through the very streets we protect. If we fail to address this matter swiftly, the officer in question may amass an alarming level of support within both the military ranks and among the general populace.

 ideology_break_1_2_event.7.d: "Despite the general's assignment in a remote and secluded outpost, his influential words have transcended the boundaries of his immediate command.

 ideology_break_3_1_event.1.t: "Caught red-handed"
 ideology_break_3_1_event.1.d: "As the foreign diplomat walked through the streets of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName], all eyes were on him. It would appear that our dealings with his country have caused considerable outrage amongst the populace — outrage so fiery and intense, that a local construction worker threw a bucket of red paint at the diplomat as soon as he saw him passing by.\n\n 'Is anyone safe from the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] bucket?' reads in block print the front page of a newspaper known predominantly from publicizing illicit affairs of renowned artists.\nSome doomsayers claim that the infamous bucket will be known as a prelude to full-blown war in the future.\nSuch notions are of course ridiculous, but surely we must do something to wrestle control of the situation and preserve our international reputation?"

 ideology_break_3_1_event.2.t: "Culture of disobedience"
 ideology_break_3_1_event.2.d: "The good news: the workers did not go on strike.\nThe bad news: it seems our actions have led to the birth of a culture of passive disapproval of the state amongst the laborers.\n\nGrotesque graffiti of political staff adorns the walls of industrial buildings, and things such as nails and bolts now routinely disappear from government-sponsored endeavors.\nLet's hope this won't escalate further and eventually dies down."
 ideology_break_3_1_event.2.f: ""
 ideology_break_3_1_event.2.a: "They should have focued on work to begin with"

 ideology_break_3_1_event.3.t: "Mixed results"
 ideology_break_3_1_event.3.d: "We have achieved mixed results. The discourse surrounding the incident has simmered down, but our actions will surely not be forgotten, especially as we have received considerable pushback from the lower rung of society.\n\nAn uneasy peace lingers in the capital, with people speculating just when another 'bucket incident' will occur."
 ideology_break_3_1_event.3.f: ""
 
 ideology_break_3_1_event.4.t: "Opposition infights"
 ideology_break_3_1_event.4.d: "We've done it!\n\nWe have successfully put most of the blame on the workers themselves. Most of the discourse has shifted away from the actual issue on to how, exactly, one is meant to express their views and in what manner one is allowed to voice their discontent.\n\nThis, luckily for us, led to major infighting between opposition groups, especially amongst those representing different societal stratas. The crisis is temporarily averted!"
 ideology_break_3_1_event.4.f: ""

 ideology_break_3_1_event.5.t: "Hole deepens"
 ideology_break_3_1_event.5.d: "Despite the steady outpour of resources, it seems like the pit we are in only ever gets deeper.\nThe diplomat still refuses to return, and communication with his country has turned much less cordial.\n\nThat being said, we can ameliorate this.\nWe just need time. And effort. And money.\n\nAnd once we throw enough money and time at this problem then, surely, it will fix itself."
 ideology_break_3_1_event.5.f: ""
 ideology_break_3_1_event.5.a: "Plug it with money"

 ideology_break_3_1_event.6.t: "Crisis averted"
 ideology_break_3_1_event.6.d: "By means fair and foul, we have managed to bribe and persuade our way into failing upwards!\n\nThe paint-covered diplomat, coerced with promises of protection, intoxicants and fine cuisine, promised to return and resume his work as if nothing had happened.\nThat being said, all of our clerks and officials are still working overtime, constantly monitoring the situation and putting out fires as they appear.\n\nAt the very least, we prevented an international scandal."
 ideology_break_3_1_event.6.f: ""
 ideology_break_3_1_event.6.a: "Phew!"

 ideology_break_3_1_event.7.t: "A night to remember"
 ideology_break_3_1_event.7.d: "Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetTitle] rushed out, willing to talk all of this over personally.\n\nNo one truly knows just what happened between them and the foreign official, however dozens of separate rumors claim to have seen the pair all over the streets of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName], partaking in intoxicated revelry, rushing like the night gale from one den of debauchery to the next.\n\nThe diplomat never even wrote home about the incident. As a matter of fact, the cooperation of our two nations, despite their differences, only grew more efficient and tight-knit.\n\nThere was, however, a new and inexplicable hole in our finances…"

 babylon_political_cohesion.1.d: "The world isn't what it used to be.\nNowadays it would appear that the average man is a nation upon himself, brimming with ideas regarding how the country should be run. The audacity!\nWorse yet, it seems that so-called freethinkers band together with the sole purpose of scrutinizing our government. We must be careful with our dealings both internal and external, or else face those stuck-up opportunists.\nThey may appear harmless at first, but given ample time and opportunities, they could tear us apart via [concept_political_discord]."

 babylon_political_cohesion.1.f: "'I call for help to England and America. They stand on the bank and jeer at me. Then comes a Russian straw.\nDrowning, I clutch at it. England and America, on the bank, shout at me on no account to clutch the Russian straw. But do they help me? No.\nThey jeer themselves and at the same time tell me not to clutch that Russian straw. I know it is a straw, but better that than nothing.'\n\nSun Yat-sen on the Republic and Soviet Russia, 1923"
