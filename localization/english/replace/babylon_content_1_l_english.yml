 sick_man.4.f: "With the initial reforms of Mahmud II completed, taking important and necessary steps to reform the Empire into a new age, a heavy debate has broken out between the largest political blocs of the nation. The [devout ig] and [armed forces ig] argue that a return to an absolutist form of Pan-Islamism will ensure a return to a stronger, centralized Ottoman State. They cite the renewed colonization efforts by Europeans and their continued industrialization as the greatest cause of concern for the country's survival.

The snakes around us, who thought us a weak plaything for their games, now look upon us in awe as we do what no other country in history has done and pull back from the brink of self-destruction. The liberals, who sought to weaken our government's absolute authority, have now been stamped out. Now none shall stand in the Sultan's way!"
