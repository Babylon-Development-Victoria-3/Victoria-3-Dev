 ottoman_primer_event.1.t:0 "The Eternal State"
 ottoman_primer_event.1.d:0 " For a long time, the Ottomans were the horror of the Europeans. Within a very short time, the Empire expanded from a small Anatolian state to a world power. The defining and unifying values were clear, bravery and Islam that held the empire together for centuries. Since 1570, the Ottoman Sultan has automatically been the Caliph of Islam and thus the protector and representative of the Islamic world. Admired by fellow Muslims and hated by the West, the Ottoman Empire moves into the new age a shadow of its former self. When Fatih Sultan Mehmet conquered Constantinople, he assured his new subjects that they would not be forced into either religion or culture and would recieve his proection universally. This is still true today; The Empire offers all its subjects freedoms that no other empire grants.... But not necessarily a voice."

 ottoman_primer_event.2.t:0 "The Eternal State Continued"
 ottoman_primer_event.2.d:0 "Dark clouds are gathering. The Eternal State, the glorious Ottoman Empire, caliphate and protector of the entire Islamic world, the rulers of the Balkans and the Middle East, the conquerors of Constantinople, the besiegers of Vienna seem to be receding. European powers are trying to unleash uprisings that are spreading in the Balkans and other parts of the empire in order to weaken us and our authority! Minorities demand freedom! Total independence! Our economic and research capabilities are lagging behind, as the Janissaries have made reforms impossible in the past... But now you are Sultan, YOU must make the right decisions to keep the Eternal Empire alive and reawaken it. Lead the Ottoman Empire back to a glorious age! For God and the Sultan!"

 ottoman_primer_event.3.t:0 "The Eternal State Continued"
 ottoman_primer_event.3.d:0 "It is no secret that our influence is declining. The Europeans despise us and do not miss a single opportunity to weaken us. Egypt has occupied regions from Palestine to Syria. Regions that are rightfully Ottoman. We must take back what was taken away from us! At the same time, the French and British are massacring Muslim countries in Africa and establishing colonies at the expense of our brothers and sisters! The Ottoman Caliphate must not stand by and watch the Muslim world being wiped out by imperialists! But even worse is the fact that Britain has a dangerous eye on Egypt. The Empire is in trouble and needs far-reaching educational and military reforms also the minorities must be deterred from rebelling. Hard times are coming for the Ottoman Empire. How far will the enemy go to weaken us? But above all, how far will YOU go, Sultan, to maintain the Empire?"

 iranian_primer_event.1.t:0 "Qajar Iran"
 iranian_primer_event.1.d:0 "The Qajar’s have ruled Iran for the last forty years, founded by the success of Agha Mohammad Khan in a civil war that saw a new dynasty be born. He was a man who saw the old borders of Iran as ours by right, and led campaigns into the Caucasus and border regions to take what is ours. He achieved many successes and expanded the Qajar Empire greatly, before being assassinated by cowards. His heirs have since struggled with the Russians and Ottomans alike who have pushed back the borders and shattered our armies in recent wars. The Qajar family is a proud one, but not the most innovative. They also struggle greatly much like most of the Iranian elite with Opium, for it is a drug which once tried is near impossible to set aside…"

 iranian_primer_event.2.t:0 "The Past"
 iranian_primer_event.2.d:0 "Iran is home to one of the oldest Empires in the world, for our history is one of power and conquest. Cyrus the Great forged the great Achaemenid Empire, the first of many, and showed that our people were not born simply to exist in mediocrity. History has been harsh, however, and though many more empires followed like the Seleucids, Parthians, and Safavids, we have slowly lost our glory. The Seleucids fell to those who carried the banner of Allah, succeeding where the Byzantines had failed for centuries. Yet from them our people came to know the holy word, finding peace in the one true God. The heights of our people were in this era, yet as the Mongols invaded and put our cities to the torch we receded once more. The great shah Ismail I founded the Safavids who ruled truly as an Iranian Empire once more and made Shi'ism the state religion."

 iranian_primer_event.3.t:0 "Recent History"
 iranian_primer_event.3.d:0 "With the wars of succession over after the death of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar blessed be his soul, our great leader Mohammad Shah Qajar now rules in Tehran. He is a man who has been born of war and strife like the rest of us, put in the heart of war to fight against the Russian dogs and named Gazi for it. It shall be him who wrests us back a semblance of honor and glory that should be ours by right, or he who pushes us over the edge to nothing as thralls of the west or slaves of the north. The last of his rebellious kin have been caught or defeated; although there is peace, it is hard to tell. Our cities are in ruin, the north a wasteland from the wars with our enemies and even Khorasan is beset by rebels seeking independence. His incorporation of the British military advisors is dangerous but at least his army is no longer simple tribesmen, a modern military force to rival even the Ottomans, though few in number. In the coming months and years, we will see if he is the man to bring us deliverance."

 iranian_primer_event.4.t:0 "The Bear In The North"
 iranian_primer_event.4.d:0 "The Russians have taken land from us steadily over the last 30 years as our alliances with the West resulted in nothing but betrayal. When the French Empire under Napoleon chose to work with the bear instead of us the Russians waged war after war and annexed the caucuses, taking land that is our right! Their merchants act with impunity in our land and refuse to pay back their massive debt to the state and moneylenders. If we do not find strong allies our sovereignty will not last for long for as soon as central Asia falls to their influence we are doubtless next.. Russia has declared its desire to get a port in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. The British are the obvious choice for a friend as they already have troops and diplomats in our capital, but they are known for their pragmatic approach to diplomacy and lack of loyalty."

 spain_primer_event.1.t:0 "The Lions Of Christ"
 spain_primer_event.1.d:0 "From the times of the Reconquista against the Muslim invaders to the time of Columbus and the great exploration of the Americas. We as Spaniards have never shirked our duty to enlighten people of Christ, progress, and civilization. We drove the Muslim invaders out so our people could feel safe once more after centuries of brutality. Since then we have lifted the people of the new world up from the depths of despair to a more enlightened society. Yet as we secured the untamed wilderness of the new world our civilizing efforts were cut short by the revolutions in France and the betrayal of our French allies in 1808 and after years of bloody warfare we drove the invaders out and our country was free once more! What did it cost, however? Our empire."

 spain_primer_event.2.d:0 "The city of Madrid. Once a seat of an empire stretching from Patagonia in South America to Alta California. The empire that brought civilization and Christ to two savage and dangerous continents lay dead only a few decades ago and what is left of our empire is nothing more than squabbling disorganized states with war and civil strife where there was once peace. Our holy mission lies incomplete and now with our weakened state, it is unlikely we can try to take back what we lost with new powers cementing there hold on this new world order and eyeing up what little influence and territories we have left of our empire."

 spain_primer_event.3.d:0 "King Ferdinand VII (Spanish: Fernando VII; 14 October 1784 – 29 September 1833)In 1830 King Ferdinand VII altered the succession law to allow women to inherit the throne and just months later his wife Maria Christina (27 April 1806 – 22 August 1878) give birth to a girl as well all known as her majesty Isabella II. This change in succession law upset the brother of Ferdinand, Don Carlos (29 March 1788 – 10 March 1855) Seeing himself as the true king of a “traditional monarchy” started an uprising against the Madrid liberals which supports the regency of Isabella II only three as of now in 1836, with a constitution limiting the power of the monarch, to restore the most progressive features of the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and to entrench the concepts of constitutionalism, parliamentarians, and separation of powers in Spain."

 spain_primer_event.4.t:0 "Spain At A Crossroads"
 spain_primer_event.4.d:0 "Spain in recent decades has seen many hardships, disorders, and losses. The people of Spain are dissolution's with the status quo and wish for stability once again. Would it be under the regency of Isabella II bringing liberal rule over Spain where the monarchy will have its powers curtailed with a fair hand of stability for the people or under Carlos and a return to a more traditional monarchy and a possible return to Spanish glory? Will we see Spain rise up and return to greatness or shall we see it turn into a middling power with limited influence or the possibility of the total dismantlement of the Spanish state and thus the end of a unified Spanish experiment of 400 years"
