 ottoman_primer_event.1.t:0 "The Eternal State"
 ottoman_primer_event.1.d:0 " For a long time, the Ottomans were the horror of the Europeans. Within a very short time, the Empire expanded from a small Anatolian state to a world power. The defining and unifying values were clear, bravery and Islam that held the empire together for centuries. Since 1570, the Ottoman Sultan has automatically been the Caliph of Islam and thus the protector and representative of the Islamic world. Admired by fellow Muslims and hated by the West, the Ottoman Empire moves into the new age a shadow of its former self. When Fatih Sultan Mehmet conquered Constantinople, he assured his new subjects that they would not be forced into either religion or culture and would recieve his proection universally. This is still true today; The Empire offers all its subjects freedoms that no other empire grants.... But not necessarily a voice."

 ottoman_primer_event.2.t:0 "The Eternal State Continued"
 ottoman_primer_event.2.d:0 "Dark clouds are gathering. The Eternal State, the glorious Ottoman Empire, caliphate and protector of the entire Islamic world, the rulers of the Balkans and the Middle East, the conquerors of Constantinople, the besiegers of Vienna seem to be receding. European powers are trying to unleash uprisings that are spreading in the Balkans and other parts of the empire in order to weaken us and our authority! Minorities demand freedom! Total independence! Our economic and research capabilities are lagging behind, as the Janissaries have made reforms impossible in the past... But now you are Sultan, YOU must make the right decisions to keep the Eternal Empire alive and reawaken it. Lead the Ottoman Empire back to a glorious age! For God and the Sultan!"

 ottoman_primer_event.3.t:0 "The Eternal State Continued"
 ottoman_primer_event.3.d:0 "It is no secret that our influence is declining. The Europeans despise us and do not miss a single opportunity to weaken us. Egypt has occupied regions from Palestine to Syria. Regions that are rightfully Ottoman. We must take back what was taken away from us! At the same time, the French and British are massacring Muslim countries in Africa and establishing colonies at the expense of our brothers and sisters! The Ottoman Caliphate must not stand by and watch the Muslim world being wiped out by imperialists! But even worse is the fact that Britain has a dangerous eye on Egypt. The Empire is in trouble and needs far-reaching educational and military reforms also the minorities must be deterred from rebelling. Hard times are coming for the Ottoman Empire. How far will the enemy go to weaken us? But above all, how far will YOU go, Sultan, to maintain the Empire?"
