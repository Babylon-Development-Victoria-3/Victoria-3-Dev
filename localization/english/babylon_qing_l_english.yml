 je_pacify_highland_tribes:0 "Pacify Highland Tribes"
 je_pacify_highland_tribes_reason:0 "Tusi, translated to "headmen" or "chieftains" are hereditary tribal leaders recognized as imperial officials by the Qing Dynasty in the frontier regions of Yunnan and Guizhou. Whilst useful for ensuring the loyalty of the Zhuang and Yi tribes in the region; the autonomy and privileges granted by the Tusi system significantly limit our ability to develop and administrate the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou."
 
 je_gateway_to_the_west:0 "Gateway to the West"
 je_gateway_to_the_west_reason:0 "The port city of Guangzhou has always been an important maritime trade hub since its incorporation into the Han Dynasty in the 3rd century AD. The city was also the staging point for Zheng He's expeditions across the Indian Ocean, and was the first arrival point for travellers from the West such as the likes of Ibn Battuta, Marco Polo and Odoric of Pordenone. Under the Qing, Guangzhou remains the only open port in China, with trade strictly regulated under the Canton System. This has granted Guangdong far greater exposure to the West, which can potentially be leveraged for access to great wealth and knowledge."
 
 je_breadbasket_of_the_south:0 "Breadbasket of the South"
 je_breadbasket_of_the_south_reason:0 "The provinces of Hunan and Jiangxi are located on some of the most agriculturally productive ground in China, with the grain surpluses from Hunan alone often exported to address shortfalls throughout the rest of China. The productivity of the soil and the wealth it has allowed local peasants to obtain has spared Huguang from the rural poverty that plagues the rest of China, but has simultaneously entrenched a conservative and agrarian social order that will undoubtedly hamper modernization."

 je_settle_the_steppe:0 "Settle the Steppe"
 je_settle_the_steppe_reason:0 "The Manchu homeland has always been sparsely populated, even more so after the migration of the Manchu Tribes southwards during the formation of the Qing Dynasty. A series of ditches and embankments known as the 'Willow Palisade' was erected in the early years of the Qing Dynasty to protect Manchuria from Han settlement. However, with the increasing expansion of the Russian Empire towards the frontiers of China, it would be prudent to further encourage the settlement and urbanization of Manchuria to further solidify the Qing Dynasty's claim to the region."
 
 je_pacify_and_settle_taiwan:0 "Bureau for the Pacification and Settlement of Taiwan"
 je_pacify_and_settle_taiwan_reason:0 "Taiwan, known to the West as Formosa, has been part of the Qing Dynasty ever since the defeat of Kingdom of Tungning in 1683. For centuries, settlement of the island has been greatly restricted due to a general disinterest from the Qing in sustaining any sort of extensive military or administrative presence on the island. Despite this, Han settlers continue to arrive on the island's shores every year, and local officials are growing increasingly interested in further settlement and pacification of Taiwan to raise additional revenue for the Qing Dynasty's expenditure."

 babylon_qing_substates.1.t:0 "The Viceroyalty of Sichuan"
 babylon_qing_substates.1.d:0 "Comprised of the Governorates of Sichuan and Yun-Gui, the Viceroyalty of Sichuan is divided between the Sinicized Sichuan Basin, once the heartland of the ancient state of Shu Han, and the isolated Yun-Gui Highlands. Whilst the highland tribes swear fealty to the Qing Emperor and have nominally agreed to adopt Chinese customs and open land for Han settlement, progress is slow and the autonomy granted to the tribes under the Tusi system remains a barrier to the development of the southern provinces."
 babylon_qing_substates.1.f:0 "Building upon the Yuan precedent, the Ming began its colonization of the southwest in the 1370s, and though its military strength waxed and waned, it was able to eliminate the largest autonomous kingdoms in the southwest by the early decades of the seventeenth century. Under the Qing, the Yongzheng Emperor's appointment of his trusted Manchu official Ortai and the aggressive campaign against Tusi offices they initiated in the 1720s in the southwest should be seen as the continuation, not the beginning, of China's colonization of the southwest."
 babylon_qing_substates.1.a:0 "We must re-double our efforts!"
 
 babylon_qing_substates.2.t:0 "The Pacification of Yun-Gui"
 babylon_qing_substates.2.d:0 "Through a series of reforms that have gradually stripped power away from the Tusi and towards provincial officials appointed by the Viceroy and Qing Emperor, the administration of Sichuan has managed to establish firm control over the administration of the Yun-Gui highlands."
 babylon_qing_substates.2.f:0 "To maintain control and loyalty amongst the tribes, it has been suggested that a system of divide and rule be put into place, with one of the tribes previously opposed to Qing rule privileged in the administration to sow division between the Zhuang, Miao and Yi."
 babylon_qing_substates.2.a:0 "The Zhuang have proven to be the most cooperative."
 babylon_qing_substates.2.b:0 "Together with the Yi, we shall rule the Highlands."
 babylon_qing_substates.2.c:0 "Like the Han, the Miao are outsiders. We should work with them."
 
 babylon_qing_substates.3.t:0 "Tribal Conflicts Erupt"
 babylon_qing_substates.3.d:0 "Tensions between the highland tribes have reached a tipping point, and a conflict seems inevitable."
 babylon_qing_substates.3.f:0 ""Feuds between the Zhuang, Yi and Miao are nothing new, though a large-scale conflict between them will have severe consequences for trade and development of the Southern Provinces as well as the safety of Han settlers who will be caught in the crossfire.""
 babylon_qing_substates.3.a:0 "Tribal affairs are none of our concern."
 babylon_qing_substates.3.b:0 "Send in the army to enforce order!"
 
 babylon_qing_substates.4.t:0 "Han Colony Raided"
 babylon_qing_substates.4.d:0 "Reports have reached Chengdu that Han settlers in the Yun-Gui Highlands have been attacked by members of the highland tribes."
 babylon_qing_substates.4.f:0 ""They came under the cover of darkness. We were awoken by the smell of acrid smoke and yells of a foreign tongue. Fearful for our lives we barred the doors and windows of our homes and waited for the noise to subside. It was dawn by the time the noise subsided and we felt safe enough to leave. All that awaited us was a scene of devastation; they had taken our livestock and grain and burnt everything else...""
 babylon_qing_substates.4.a:0 "They knew the risks. There is nothing we can do."
 babylon_qing_substates.4.b:0 "Dispatch a punitive expedition!"
 
 babylon_qing_substates.5.t:0 "Highlanders Sinicized!"
 babylon_qing_substates.5.d:0 "Our efforts to assimilate the highland tribes have borne fruit, with many villages adopting Chinese customs and language and welcoming the arrival of Han migrants into their communities."
 babylon_qing_substates.5.f:0 ""The district magistrate of Anshun has reported an uptick in the registration of highlanders within the district records. Fifty-three individuals have adopted the family name 'Wang', twenty-seven have adopted the family name 'Li', and three more the family name 'Liu'.""
 babylon_qing_substates.5.a:0 "All is proceeding according to plan."
